                <h2>What is Propaganda?</h2>


                <p>Propaganda is communication that is used primarily to influence an audience and further an agenda.</p>
                <p>It may not be objective and may be presenting facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis or perception.</p>

                <p class="stylename">Propaganda is associated with material prepared by informational entities: an example is a government.</p>
                <p class="stylename">It is associated with a manipulative approach. A wide range of mediums are used for conveying propaganda messages, such as posters. </p>
